*[Verified](https://fastestknowntime.com/route/hodder-way-uk) on the FKT website*

I stumbled on this route while browsing the [Fastest Known Time](https://fastestknowntime.com) website a few weeks back. At only 28 miles it caught my eye as something that I could do with little preparation, and serve as excellent training for some of [the longer runs I have planned](/#schedule).

There is an [official website](http://hodderway.co.uk) with history, route description, and maps. Along with pages on the [LDWA website](https://www.ldwa.org.uk/ldp/members/show_path.php?path_name=Hodder+Way) and [Fastest Known Time](https://fastestknowntime.com).

The elevation profile trends downhill, which cunningly disguises the difficulty of the terrain. It's very overgrown and technical in places; There are sticky, boggy sections, and some of the black and white residents in the access land can be a bit grumpy.

I decided to go ahead with this run on a bit of a whim. And so was unsupported and running by myself the entire time. In fact, it's so quiet here compared to the Lake District I barely saw another person all day.

## The start (09:53am)

At the top of Feltham Moor (Cross o' Greet), The start is easy enough to find and is the highest point of the day.

> Where the fence makes a slight bend left you should see, weather permitting, on your left some boggy ground with areas of longish grass interspersed with pools of standing water.

It was fresh setting off. I wore a jacket, which was a mistake. I always tell my wife when she goes out to "dress for the second mile", but today I neglected that advice. And so within a few minutes, I found myself running down a hill attempting to roll up and stuff a jacket into my pack.

The landscape and terrain for the first 10 miles are fantastic. My legs felt good, and I tapped away at a nice pace.

At the Cross of Greet Bridge, a narrow single-track flows parallel to the river. After a small section of access land where I somehow deviated wildly from the path, I found myself closing in on Gisburn forest. The best part of the route and a place I highly recommend visiting. Whether on foot on with a mountain bike.

I followed undulating trails through woodland, then alongside Stocks Reservoir. The views were mega and the sun was starting to shine.

Somewhere between Gisburn and Slaidburn, I received a call from our solicitors,

> Congratulations, we just wanted to tell you that you have now completed on your house purchase.

Shortly after I found myself passing through the lovely village of Slaidburn and into vast grassy fields. Running alongside the river for the first time in miles.

I find thick grass drains the energy out of the legs a bit, but still, before long I had reached Newton. Thinking I'm now well on my way to the half way point, The Inn At Whitewell.

The way to Whitewell is mostly access land and fields with several river crossings over increasingly sketchy looking bridges.

I expect to hit Whitewell somewhere inside mile 14. Worryingly I was at 17 miles when I passed the place I got married - The Inn At Whitewell. Had I really managed to cover an extra 2/3 miles retracing my steps and deviating from the route? I think I must have just remembered this information wrong when reviewing the route the day before.

I've done a lot of walking in this area and am pretty confident I know what to expect for the next section: Boggy fields.
(I'm not a huge fan). Yet, because of the dry spell we've enjoyed lately, most of the bogs were instead ankle-snapping craters. Of course this being Bowland there was still plenty of mud about (and there still will be on my feet for many days).

I shuffle up the climb out of Whitewell, one of the biggest of the course. By now my legs were fading thanks to pounding the downhills earlier. I live in a flat part of the world, so consistent downhill isn't something I'm used to. Making my way through seemingly endless fields filled with livestock and no clear path marked. For an area that holds so many happy memories, this was probably a low point of the day. It's slow going. I don't spend enough time with a map, so I'm pretty rusty quickly getting my bearings at first. Thanks to today though, my map reading has dramatically improved.

At 23 miles in I entered *another* field, one with cows. But the vibe was all off. The cows instantly grouped, stared me down, challenged me. I kept moving, trying to talk to them,

> "hey guys, it's all good, I'm just going to head over here, and I'll be out of your field and on my way."

They weren't interested.

They charged. I ran. No, I sprinted. Looking at the data now I was doing 5min/mi on tired legs during my hasty exit. I could've done without that surge of adrenaline. But I made it out unscathed.

Not many miles left at least, I remember thinking to myself.

Occasionally I found myself deep in overgrown woodland. Thick with nettles and brambles desperate to trip you up or snag your clothing. My legs took a real beating and are still tingling a day later from the stings and scrapes. That said, I found this battle more enjoyable than slogging across fields.

The map as dense as the foliage, I spent a lot of time retracing my steps, second-guessing my decisions. Making progress as slow as my navigation skills. I was taking longer than anticipated on this technical section, lost a lot of time. It felt like I was only either walking or standing still.

From mile 24 onwards, I was able to run again. It was great to open my stride up and roll a steady pace. Remarkably, my legs, although tired still felt they could cope with the task at hand. I knew I was going to finish strong.

The final miles are some of the best. The undulating single-track path snakes next to the river. You're in and out of woodland, crossing streams, and generally enjoying faster, more varied ground again.

There's a small road section followed by a final "F*ck You" from a field before the River Ribble comes into view and the adventure draws to a rapid conclusion.

I stopped the clock at 5h 10m 48s.
